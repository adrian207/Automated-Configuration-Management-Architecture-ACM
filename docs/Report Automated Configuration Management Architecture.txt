## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive technical specification and outlines the required supporting documentation for a tiered, platform-agnostic, automated configuration management architecture. The solution is designed for deployment across cloud (Azure, AWS) and on-premises (vSphere, Hyper-V, OpenStack) environments.

Two distinct architectural blueprints are specified to meet diverse operational needs: a **Hybrid Pull Model (Ansible + DSC)** for continuous state enforcement and an **Ansible-Native Push Model** for complex orchestration. Both are built upon a common foundation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), centralized secrets management, and robust, automated monitoring.

This specification includes detailed guidance on network architecture, security controls, data flows, backup strategies, and operational procedures required for successful deployment and lifecycle management of the system.

### 1.1 Document Audience

- **Primary:** Infrastructure architects, DevOps engineers, platform teams
- **Secondary:** Security teams, operations management, compliance officers
- **Tertiary:** Executive stakeholders, project managers

### 1.2 Assumptions

- Active Directory infrastructure exists for Windows environments
- Network connectivity between all infrastructure tiers is available or can be established
- Adequate compute and storage resources are available for infrastructure components
- Git repository infrastructure (GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Bitbucket) is available
- DNS infrastructure is in place for service discovery

---

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

The following principles are foundational to both architectural blueprints and must be adhered to in any implementation.

### 2.1 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The entire infrastructure, from network components to application configuration, will be defined and managed as code to ensure repeatability, versioning, and automated provisioning.

**Provisioning Tooling:** Terraform will be used to provision all foundational infrastructure.

**Configuration Tooling:** Ansible will be used for all software-layer configuration.

**Repository Strategy:** A monorepo approach will be used with clear directory structure:
```
/terraform/          # Infrastructure provisioning
/ansible/            # Configuration management
  /inventory/        # Dynamic and static inventories
  /roles/            # Reusable Ansible roles
  /playbooks/        # Orchestration playbooks
  /group_vars/       # Environment-specific variables
  /host_vars/        # Host-specific variables
/dsc/                # PowerShell DSC configurations
  /configurations/   # DSC configuration scripts
  /resources/        # Custom DSC resources
/docs/               # Architecture and operational documentation
/tests/              # Automated test suites
```

### 2.2 Centralized Secrets Management

All sensitive data (API keys, passwords, certificates) must be stored and managed within a dedicated secrets management service. Secrets will not be stored in plain text within source code repositories.

**Mechanism:** Automation tooling will retrieve secrets from the vault at runtime for in-memory use only.

**Platform-Specific Implementations:**

- **Azure:** Azure Key Vault
- **AWS:** AWS Secrets Manager
- **On-Premises / IaaS:** A highly available HashiCorp Vault cluster (minimum 3 nodes with Raft storage backend)

**Secret Naming Convention:**
```
{environment}/{service}/{secret-type}/{secret-name}
Example: prod/dsc/registration/pull-server-key
```

**Secret Rotation Policy:**
- Service account passwords: 90 days
- API keys: 180 days
- Certificates: 365 days (auto-renewal at 30 days before expiry)
- Registration keys: 180 days

### 2.3 Automated Monitoring and Alerting

A dedicated monitoring stack is required to provide real-time visibility into the health and performance of the configuration management infrastructure.

**On-Premises Stack:** Prometheus for data collection, Grafana for visualization, and Alertmanager for notifications.

**Alert Delivery:** Alertmanager will use a third-party service like SendGrid for email delivery, with credentials stored securely in the secrets vault. Integration with PagerDuty or similar on-call management system is recommended.

**Azure-Native Solution:** For Azure deployments, Azure Monitor and Log Analytics will provide these capabilities as a managed platform service.

**AWS-Native Solution:** For AWS deployments, Amazon CloudWatch and CloudWatch Logs with SNS for alerting.

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- Configuration drift detection rate
- Failed configuration runs
- Node check-in health (last seen timestamp)
- Secrets vault availability and latency
- Pull server/control plane CPU, memory, disk utilization
- Network connectivity between tiers
- Certificate expiration warnings (30, 14, 7 days)

**Alert Severity Levels:**
- **Critical:** Immediate response required (control plane down, secrets vault unreachable)
- **Warning:** Investigation required within 4 hours (high drift rate, nodes missing check-ins)
- **Info:** Informational alerts (successful deployments, scheduled maintenance)

---

## 3. Architectural Blueprints

This specification defines two distinct models that can be deployed based on operational requirements. Both models will be managed in a single source code repository using the Git branching strategy defined in Section 7.1.

### 3.1 Blueprint A: Hybrid Pull Model (Ansible + DSC)

This model uses Ansible for initial onboarding and leverages the DSC agent for continuous, autonomous drift correction. It's ideal for enforcing a strict, immutable baseline.

#### 3.1.1 Azure Implementation (PaaS)

The recommended cloud-native implementation utilizes Azure Automation DSC.

**Components:**
- Azure Automation Account (per environment)
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Azure Monitor + Log Analytics for monitoring
- Azure Blob Storage for DSC module storage
- Azure Arc for hybrid/on-premises node connectivity (optional)

**Node Capacity:** Up to 5,000 nodes per automation account (Azure limit)

**Cost Optimization:** Use separate automation accounts for dev/test/prod to avoid cross-environment contamination.

#### 3.1.2 On-Premises / IaaS Implementation

This follows a prescriptive scaling path based on node count.

##### Small Tier (<250 Nodes)

**Architecture:**
- Single Windows Server (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD)
- DSC Pull Server with default ESE database
- Co-located monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)

**High Availability:** Not recommended at this tier; backup/restore for DR only

**Database:** ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) - built-in

##### Medium Tier (250 - 1,500 Nodes)

**Architecture:**
- 2x DSC Pull Servers (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM each)
- External Microsoft SQL Server (Standard Edition, 8 vCPU, 32GB RAM)
- DFS-R (Distributed File System Replication) for DSC module/configuration replication between pull servers
- Dedicated monitoring infrastructure (3-node Prometheus cluster)

**High Availability:** 
- Active-Active pull servers behind DNS round-robin
- SQL Server basic availability (scheduled backups, warm standby optional)

**Database Requirements:**
- SQL Server 2019 or later
- 100GB initial allocation, 500GB maximum
- Automated backup every 4 hours

##### Large Tier (>1,500 Nodes)

**Architecture:**
- 4+ DSC Pull Servers behind Load Balancer (4 vCPU, 32GB RAM each)
- SQL Server Always On Availability Group (Enterprise Edition, 16 vCPU, 64GB RAM, 3-node cluster)
- Redundant DFS-R cluster (3+ file servers)
- High-availability monitoring infrastructure (5-node Prometheus cluster with remote storage)

**High Availability:**
- Load Balancer (F5, HAProxy, or Azure Load Balancer)
- SQL Always On with automatic failover
- Geographic redundancy for DR (optional)

**Scaling Formula:** Add 1 pull server per 500 additional nodes beyond baseline

**Load Balancer Configuration:**
- Health check: HTTPS GET to `/PSDSCPullServer.svc`
- Session persistence: Source IP affinity
- Timeout: 300 seconds
- SSL offloading: Optional (requires certificate management)

#### 3.1.3 Workflow for Hybrid Pull Model

1. **Initial Provisioning:** Terraform creates base infrastructure
2. **Onboarding:** Ansible playbook installs DSC agent and configures LCM
3. **Registration:** Node registers with pull server using registration key from vault
4. **Configuration Assignment:** Pull server assigns configuration based on node role/environment
5. **Continuous Enforcement:** DSC LCM checks for drift every 15 minutes, applies corrections every 30 minutes
6. **Reporting:** Nodes report status to pull server; monitoring scrapes metrics

### 3.2 Blueprint B: Ansible-Native Push Model

This model uses Ansible exclusively for all configuration, orchestration, and state enforcement tasks. It's optimal for environments requiring complex, multi-system workflows.

#### 3.2.1 Architecture Overview

**Control Plane:** Central Ansible Tower or AWX cluster serves as the control plane, initiating all configuration pushes.

**State Enforcement:** State is enforced by scheduling recurring playbook runs from Ansible Tower/AWX.

#### 3.2.2 Scaling Tiers

##### Small Tier (<500 Nodes)

**Architecture:**
- Single Ansible Tower/AWX instance (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 250GB SSD)
- PostgreSQL database (co-located or dedicated: 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
- Redis for caching (co-located)

**Capacity:** Up to 100 concurrent job forks

##### Medium Tier (500 - 2,000 Nodes)

**Architecture:**
- 2x Ansible Tower/AWX instances in active-active configuration (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM each)
- Dedicated PostgreSQL cluster (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, streaming replication)
- Dedicated Redis cluster (2-node)
- Shared filesystem for project synchronization (NFS or cloud object storage)

**Capacity:** Up to 400 concurrent job forks

**Load Balancing:** Application load balancer with sticky sessions

##### Large Tier (>2,000 Nodes)

**Architecture:**
- 4+ Ansible Tower/AWX instances behind load balancer (16 vCPU, 64GB RAM each)
- PostgreSQL high-availability cluster (16 vCPU, 32GB RAM, 3-node with Patroni)
- Redis Sentinel cluster (3-node for HA)
- Distributed object storage for projects (S3, Azure Blob, MinIO)
- Isolated execution environments using container runtime

**Capacity:** 1,000+ concurrent job forks

**Execution Node Strategy:** Deploy dedicated execution nodes for compute-intensive operations (separate from control plane)

**Scaling Formula:** Add 1 control plane node per 750 additional nodes

#### 3.2.3 Platform-Specific Implementations

**Azure:**
- Use Azure Database for PostgreSQL (managed service)
- Azure Cache for Redis (managed service)
- Azure Blob Storage for project storage
- Azure Container Instances for execution nodes (optional)

**AWS:**
- Use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (managed service)
- Amazon ElastiCache for Redis (managed service)
- Amazon S3 for project storage
- Amazon ECS for execution nodes (optional)

**On-Premises:**
- Self-managed PostgreSQL with streaming replication
- Self-managed Redis with Sentinel
- NFS or GlusterFS for shared storage

#### 3.2.4 Workflow for Ansible-Native Push Model

1. **Initial Provisioning:** Terraform creates base infrastructure
2. **Inventory Synchronization:** Dynamic inventory pulls node information from CMDBs, cloud APIs
3. **Job Scheduling:** Tower/AWX schedules playbook runs based on defined intervals
4. **Execution:** Control plane initiates SSH/WinRM connections to managed nodes
5. **Configuration Application:** Playbooks execute idempotently, making only necessary changes
6. **Reporting:** Job results stored in PostgreSQL, metrics exposed to monitoring
7. **Drift Detection:** Scheduled check-mode runs detect configuration drift without applying changes

#### 3.2.5 State Enforcement Strategy

**Baseline Configuration:** Daily full playbook runs (off-peak hours: 2:00 AM local time)

**Critical Services:** Every 4 hours for security-critical configurations

**Application Deployments:** On-demand via webhook triggers or manual launches

**Drift Detection:** Hourly check-mode runs with alerting on detected changes

New server instances will be automatically configured and registered with the configuration management system.

#### 7.2.1 Windows Onboarding (Hybrid DSC Model)

**Method:** Active Directory Group Policy (GPO)

**GPO Configuration:**

1. Create GPO: "DSC Configuration Management Enrollment"
2. Scope: Apply to OUs containing servers to be managed
3. Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Scripts → Startup
4. Script: `C:\Scripts\Configure-DSC.ps1`

**PowerShell Script (Configure-DSC.ps1):**

See Appendix A for complete script.

**Key Actions:**
- Detect environment based on AD site or subnet
- Retrieve registration key from secrets vault (via service account)
- Configure LCM with appropriate pull server URL
- Set configuration mode to ApplyAndAutoCorrect
- Set refresh frequency and reboot behavior

#### 7.2.2 Linux Onboarding (Hybrid DSC Model)

**Method:** Ansible playbook executed during server provisioning

See Appendix B for complete playbook.

**Execution Methods:**
- Terraform provisioner (local-exec or remote-exec)
- Cloud-init user data script
- Kickstart post-installation script
- Manual execution for legacy systems

#### 7.2.3 Node Onboarding (Ansible-Native Model)

**Method:** Dynamic inventory + SSH key distribution

**Process:**

1. **SSH Key Distribution:**
   - Public key added to `authorized_keys` during provisioning
   - Cloud-init for cloud instances
   - Kickstart for on-premises Linux
   - GPO for Windows (WinRM certificate or CredSSP)

2. **Dynamic Inventory:**
   - Node automatically appears in inventory upon provisioning
   - Ansible Tower/AWX syncs inventory every 15 minutes
   - Tags applied based on metadata (environment, role, application)

3. **Initial Configuration:**
   - Scheduled job template runs against newly discovered nodes
   - Applies baseline configuration
   - Installs monitoring agents
   - Configures security hardening

### 7.3 Configuration Versioning Strategy

**Principle:** All configurations are versioned and immutable once deployed.

**Version Tracking:**
- Git commit SHA stored as tag on deployed nodes
- DSC: Node metadata includes configuration version
- Ansible: Set fact with deployment version, store in custom inventory variable

**Rollback Procedure:**

**DSC:**
1. Identify previous working configuration version (Git tag)
2. Recompile MOF files from that Git commit
3. Publish to pull server with higher version number but old content
4. Nodes automatically pull and apply on next refresh

**Ansible:**
1. Identify previous working job template run
2. Re-run job template against affected nodes
3. Or: Git revert commit, trigger new deployment

**Compatibility Matrix:**

| Component | Supported Versions |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Terraform | 1.5.x, 1.6.x, 1.7.x |
| Ansible Core | 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 |
| Ansible Tower | 3.8.x, 4.x |
| AWX | 21.x, 22.x, 23.x |
| PowerShell | 5.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 |
| Python | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 |
| WMF (Windows) | 5.1 |
| OMI (Linux DSC) | 1.6.x |

**Deprecation Policy:**
- 90-day notice before removing support for tool versions
- Migration guide provided
- Automated checks for deprecated features in CI/CD pipeline

## 11. Testing Strategy

### 11.1 Testing Philosophy

**Shift-Left Approach:** Testing begins at development time, not deployment time.

**Test Pyramid:**
1. **Unit Tests (70%):** Fast, isolated, run on every commit
2. **Integration Tests (20%):** Test component interactions, run on PR
3. **End-to-End Tests (10%):** Full system validation, run before production deployment

### 11.2 Unit Testing

**Ansible:**
- **Tool:** Molecule with Docker or Vagrant
- **Scope:** Individual roles
- **Test Cases:**
  - Syntax validation (ansible-lint)
  - Idempotency testing (run twice, no changes second time)
  - Expected system state validation

**Example Molecule Test:**
```yaml
---
dependency:
  name: galaxy
driver:
  name: docker
platforms:
  - name: centos8
    image: centos:8
    pre_build_image: true
provisioner:
  name: ansible
  lint: |
    set -e
    ansible-lint
verifier:
  name: testinfra
  lint: |
    set -e
    flake8
```

**PowerShell DSC:**
- **Tool:** Pester
- **Scope:** Individual DSC resources and configurations
- **Test Cases:**
  - MOF compilation succeeds
  - Resource syntax validation
  - Expected properties set correctly

**Example Pester Test:**
```powershell
Describe "Web Server Configuration" {
    It "Should compile without errors" {
        { . .\WebServer.ps1; WebServer -OutputPath TestDrive:\ } | Should -Not -Throw
    }
    
    It "Should create a MOF file" {
        Test-Path "TestDrive:\localhost.mof" | Should -Be $true
    }
}
```

### 11.3 Integration Testing

### Appendix C: Common Operational Tasks

#### Task 1: Adding a New Configuration (DSC)

1. Create new DSC configuration script in `/dsc/configurations/`
2. Test locally: Compile MOF and validate
3. Commit to feature branch
4. Create pull request
5. After approval, merge to `main`
6. CI/CD pipeline compiles MOF files
7. Publish to DSC Pull Server (dev first, then production)
8. Assign configuration to nodes via node registration or configuration names

#### Task 2: Adding a New Playbook (Ansible)

1. Create new playbook in `/ansible/playbooks/`
2. Develop roles if needed in `/ansible/roles/`
3. Test locally using Molecule
4. Commit to feature branch
5. Create pull request
6. After approval, merge to `main`
7. Ansible Tower/AWX syncs project automatically
8. Create Job Template in Tower/AWX
9. Set schedule if recurring, or execute on-demand

#### Task 3: Rotating Secrets

**Automated (Preferred):**
- Vault dynamic secrets with TTL rotation
- Scheduled job template to rotate service account passwords

**Manual:**
1. Generate new secret value
2. Update in HashiCorp Vault: `vault kv put secret/{env}/{service}/{name} key=<new-value>`
3. Update consuming services (Ansible Tower credentials, DSC configurations)
4. Verify services still function
5. Archive old secret (keep for 30 days for rollback)

#### Task 4: Scaling Infrastructure

**DSC Pull Server (Medium to Large Tier):**
1. Provision new pull server via Terraform
2. Configure DFS-R replication from existing pull servers
3. Configure SQL Server access
4. Add to load balancer pool
5. Validate health checks passing
6. Monitor for 24 hours before considering stable

**Ansible Tower/AWX:**
1. Provision new control plane node via Terraform
2. Install Tower/AWX using inventory-based installation
3. Point to existing PostgreSQL cluster
4. Add to load balancer pool
5. Validate health checks passing
6. Sync projects and verify execution capacity increased

#### Task 5: Troubleshooting Failed Configuration

**DSC:**
1. Check pull server logs: `C:\Windows\Logs\DSC\PullServer\`
2. Check node LCM logs: `Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-DSC/Operational"`
3. Review compliance reports in SQL database
4. Test configuration MOF manually: `Start-DscConfiguration -Path <path> -Wait -Verbose`

**Ansible:**
1. Review job output in Tower/AWX UI
2. Check Ansible logs on control plane: `/var/log/tower/` or `/var/log/awx/`
3. Re-run job with increased verbosity: `-vvv`
4. Check managed node connectivity: Test SSH/WinRM access
5. Check secrets vault access from control plane
