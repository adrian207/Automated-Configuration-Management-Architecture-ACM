- Component recovered within RTO
- Data loss within RPO
- All functionality restored
- Procedures accurate and complete

#### Test 2: Database Restore

**Objective:** Validate database backup and restore procedures

**Procedure:**
1. Take snapshot of current database
2. Note current record count and recent data
3. Restore database from backup (1 day old)
4. Verify data integrity
5. Restore to current state

**Success Criteria:**
- Restore completes successfully
- Data integrity verified (checksum, record counts)
- No corruption detected
- Restore time within RTO

#### Test 3: Full DR Exercise

**Objective:** Validate complete DR capability

**Procedure:**
1. Schedule maintenance window
2. Take snapshots of all production systems
3. Simulate disaster (shut down all systems)
4. Execute full recovery procedures
5. Validate all services restored
6. Run validation tests
7. Restore to snapshots or keep recovered systems

**Success Criteria:**
- All components recovered within RTO
- Data loss within RPO
- All validation tests pass
- DR team successfully followed procedures

## 8. Regression Testing

**Purpose:** Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality

**When to Run:**
- After every production deployment
- After major configuration changes
- Weekly automated run

**Test Suite:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# regression-test-suite.sh

echo "=== Configuration Management Regression Tests ==="

# Test 1: Node connectivity
ansible all -i inventory/production -m ping || exit 1

# Test 2: Vault accessible
vault status || exit 1

# Test 3: DSC Pull Server responding
curl -f https://dsc.corp.contoso.com || exit 1

# Test 4: AWX accessible
awx ping || exit 1

# Test 5: Monitoring collecting metrics
METRICS=$(curl -s 'http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=up' | jq '.data.result | length')
[[ $METRICS -gt 0 ]] || exit 1

# Test 6: Deploy test configuration
awx job_templates launch "Regression - Test Config" --monitor || exit 1

# Test 7: Drift detection working
# (simulate drift, wait, verify alert)

# Test 8: Secret retrieval working
vault kv get secret/test/regression || exit 1

echo "=== All Regression Tests Passed ==="
```

## 9. Compliance Testing

**Purpose:** Validate security and compliance controls

### 9.1 SOC 2 Control Testing

| Control | Test Procedure | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Access Control (CC6.1) | Verify RBAC policies enforced | Screenshot of denied access |
| Change Management (CC8.1) | Verify all changes have approval | Change request tickets |
| Encryption (CC6.7) | Verify TLS and disk encryption | SSL Labs report, encryption status |
| Monitoring (CC7.2) | Verify all events logged | Log samples, audit trail |
| Backup (CC5.2) | Verify backups successful, test restore | Backup logs, restore test results |

### 9.2 Vulnerability Scanning

**Tool:** Nessus, OpenVAS, or similar

**Scan Frequency:**
- Weekly: Authenticated scans
- Monthly: Full comprehensive scan

**Procedure:**
```bash
# Launch scan
nessus scan launch --policy "Authenticated Scan" --targets "10.10.10.0/24,10.10.20.0/24,10.10.30.0/24"

# Export results
nessus scan export <scan-id> --format pdf --output vulnerability-scan-results.pdf

# Review findings
# Create tickets for Critical/High findings
# Track remediation
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0-10.0) in production
- All High vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-8.9) remediated within 30 days
